*Hi*, my name is Robb Böhnke, I'm a seasoned software engineer. I live in Berlin.

I enjoy working on the boundary of human and computer interaction – be it in the form of API design, animations or assistive technologies.

I'm currently building [Moving Parts](https://movingparts.io), a scalable library of interface components for SwiftUI.

If you would like to get in touch with me, send an e-mail to [robb@robb.is](mailto:robb@robb.is). You can also check out my [GitHub profile][github] or follow me on [Mastodon][mastodon] or [Twitter][twitter], if you'd like.

### Notable Contributions

#### Google 2019–2021

In _Kernel_, Google's product incubation space within the Google Research organization, my work focused on fast-paced iteration on highly polished prototypes.

#### Apple 2016–2019

In the _UIKit_ team, I helped ship Drag and Drop on iPad for iOS 11 and prototyped upcoming APIs. At _Health_, I developed a scalable unidirectional data flow architecture to drive our Apple-internal application.

#### Freelance Developer, 2013–2016

Focusing on staff augmentation for US and German companies, I've helped clients ship both customer facing applications as well as SDKs for third party developers on tight dead-lines. I've worked with companies such as Artsy, Xamarin and Automatic.

#### SoundCloud 2010–2013

I developed the official _SoundCloud_ Mac app as part of my internship in the Web API team, then transitioned to a full-time role and helped launch SoundCloud on iPad.
